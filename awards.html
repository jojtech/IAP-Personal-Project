            <h3>Posthumous recognition</h3>
            <p>
                Posthumous recognition for Wangarĩ Maathai includes the establishment of Wangarĩ Gardens in Washington, DC, a 2.7-acre community garden project honoring her commitment to environmental protection and community engagement. The University of Pittsburgh dedicated the Wangarĩ Maathai Trees and Garden, featuring red maples symbolizing her environmental dedication and a circular flower garden representing her global vision. 
                A statue was unveiled at her alma mater, Benedictine College, in 2014, and a mural was added during the 2019 renovation of Westerman Hall. Nairobi renamed Forest Road to Wangarĩ Maathai Road in 2016, recognizing her efforts against deforestation. UNESCO published a graphic novel in 2015, depicting her story as part of their series on Women in African History. These diverse tributes underscore Maathai's enduring influence on environmental activism, education, and community empowerment.
